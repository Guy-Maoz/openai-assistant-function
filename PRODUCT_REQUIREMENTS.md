# Product Requirements: OpenAI Assistant Agent

## 1. Overview

The goal is to create an AI agent leveraging the OpenAI Assistant API. This agent will be capable of performing tasks and interacting based on user prompts.

## 2. Core Functionality

-   **Assistant Creation**: The system should be able to create a new OpenAI Assistant with specified instructions, model, and tools (if any).
-   **Thread Management**: The system should manage conversation threads, allowing for persistent interactions.
    -   Create new threads.
    -   Add messages to existing threads.
-   **Message Handling**:
    -   Send user messages to the assistant.
    -   Retrieve and display assistant responses.
-   **Run Management**:
    -   Initiate runs (processing of messages by the assistant).
    -   Check the status of runs.
    -   Handle responses and potential actions/tool calls from the assistant.
-   **API Key Management**: Securely manage and utilize the OpenAI API key.

## 3. Technical Requirements

-   **Language**: Python
-   **Key Library**: OpenAI Python SDK
-   **API Interaction**: All interactions with the OpenAI API should be robust, with appropriate error handling.
-   **Configuration**: API keys and other sensitive configurations should be managed via environment variables.

## 4. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

-   Support for OpenAI Assistant tools (Code Interpreter, Retrieval, Function Calling).
-   File management for assistants.
-   More sophisticated state management for multiple users or conversations.
-   A user interface (CLI or Web).
